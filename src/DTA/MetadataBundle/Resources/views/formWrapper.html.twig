{#  
    The dynamic extend is for extending the template of the currently active domain, 
    (the overridden domainKey value is passed by the renderWithDomainMenu method
    within the DTABaseController.
    The according template files are located in 
        src/DTA/MetadataBundle/Resources/views/domainKey/base.html.twig
    Template inheritance is basically for inheriting the correct domain menu.

    The reason why this is an extra template is that if added to the autoform template,
    problems arise when including the autoform as nested form via ajax requests.
    In this case, no domain menu and other domain specific elements shall be rendered
    in the response, but just the plain form.
