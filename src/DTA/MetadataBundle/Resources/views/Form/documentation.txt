This directory contains all templates that have to do with form rendering.

Note that this is neither a symfony nor a twig convention.
The same applies to the Types subdirectory.
So feel free to move the files, as long as you update the references.

Short overview: 

./Entity: templates for model forms that need additional logic to be
rendered. 

genericBaseForm: renders a form for an entity (Person, Publication, Publishingcompany, 
DtaUser, etc.) as specified by the form types (src/DTA/MetadataBundle/Form/Type)

dtaFormExtensions: Specifies how to render the special widgets developed for the
dta application. These include for instance the dynamic collection 
(everything that has for instance a "+ Bildquelle hinzuf√ºgen" button below it) 
to manage 1:n or n:n relationships.

form_div_layout_dta: makes modifications to the default rendering of the 
different input types (checkbox, select, etc.). For instance, some modifications
to the default way in which checkboxes are rendered are done, 
to adhere to the twitter bootstrap css requirements.
Additionally offers additional convenient configuration options for how a 
form for a certain model type (like the date specification) is displayed. 
See viewConfigurationForModels.

viewConfigurationForModels: Here, it can be conveniently specified whether a 
certain model type (like the date specification) should be rendered with all inputs 
on a single line, or whether the default (tree-like) view should be used 
(with all form elements on a separate row with the label in the 
left column and the input in the right).
