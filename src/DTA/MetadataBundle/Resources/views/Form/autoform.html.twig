{# 
    Template for rendering forms for any model type (i.e. database entity).
    Used for creating and editing entities.
    By default, a new entity is created.

    This template can be overriden by simply defining a properly named template for the model class to render.
    The naming convention is <className>Form.html.twig where the according file must be placed under
    the src/DTAMetadataBundle/Resources/views/Form/standalone directory. As the name implies,
    this will affect only standalone forms for the specific entity, because the autoform must
    receive the class as "top level class", i.e. the class for which the root form is rendered.
    ! Note that there's still the form wrapper which then includes the altered template instead of the autoform.
    This is useful because the form wrapper handles some of the logic where to submit the form.
