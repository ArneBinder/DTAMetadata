This directory contains templates for model classes that shall be rendered 
differently from the default form layout as produced by autoform.html.twig.
This could be the case if rendering requires additional logic.

I.e. for the Tasktype (Zoning, OCR, ...) no parent selector shall be displayed
for the root of the tasktype tree.

Simply put a file in this directory named <modelClassName>Form.html.twig and 
the model class will not longer be rendered using the autoform template.
