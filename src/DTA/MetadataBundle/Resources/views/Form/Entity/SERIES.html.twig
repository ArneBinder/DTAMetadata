{# This template controls how the form for the shared core publication data looks like. 
   It covers all form fields that the book publication type requires (title, author, sources, etc.).
   Specialized publication types can reuse it by overriding any number of blocks (work, publication, sources, etc.)

   Some macros (e.g. "dta.beginFieldset") are defined in buildingBlocks.html.twig (in the views/Form directory).
