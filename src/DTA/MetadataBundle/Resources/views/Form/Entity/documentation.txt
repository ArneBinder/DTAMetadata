This directory contains the templates for the individual forms.
Each entity that should be editable via the view needs 

* a php model, as generated by the ORM from the xml schemata and 
  stored in the src/DTA/MetadataBundle/Model directory.
* a form type that defines what form input is mapped to which object property and what functionality and data the input should have.
  these files are stored in the src/DTA/MetadataBundle/Form/Type directory.
* a template that renders the form inputs in the right order and with the right markup.
  this is not strictly symfony standard, and my convention is to store these files in 
  src/DTA/MetadataBundle/Resources/views/Form/Entity
